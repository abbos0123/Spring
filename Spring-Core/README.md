# Spring Core :book:

The Spring Framework is an open-source framework for building enterprise Java applications. Spring aims to simplify the complex and cumbersome enterprise Java application development process by offering a framework that includes technologies such as:

- Aspect-oriented programming (AOP)
- Dependency injection (DI)
- Plain Old Java Object (POJO)

Even with all these technologies, Spring is a lightweight framework that can be used to create scalable, secure, and robust enterprise web applications.

At a macro-level, we can consider the Spring framework a collection of sub frameworks such as Spring Web Flow, Spring MVC, and Spring ORM. In addition to Java, Spring also supports Kotlin and Groovy.
